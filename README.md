# Clearance Price for WooCommerce

This plugin allows you to define a *clearance price* for each WooCommerce product. When enabled, the clearance price can replace the regular product price during a configurable date range. It also provides options to hide the regular price range on variable products and to display a "Clearance!" badge instead of the default sale badge.

## Features
- Set a custom clearance price for simple and variable products
- Overwrite prices in the cart when the clearance period is active
- Optional replacement of the sale badge with a "Clearance!" label
- Administrative settings to control date interval and product types
